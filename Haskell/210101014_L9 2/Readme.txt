Qn brief desc. - Prime numbers generation

I have followed all the instructions as mentioned in the problem statement. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To compile the program run the command ghc primeGenerator.hs in the terminal
To run the program run the command ./primeGenerator in the terminal


This Prolog program is designed to generate the prime numbers upto a limit entered by the user. The program uses sieve function
which recursively removes the non prime numbers from the list [2..n].
