Qn brief desc. - Frequency sorting of characters in a string

I have followed all the instructions as mentioned in the problem statement. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To compile the program run the command ghc -o freqSort freqSort.hs in the terminal
To run the program run the command ./freqSort in the terminal


This Prolog program is designed to take input form the user. Then it sorts the characters of the string in the increasing
order of frequency. I have printed all the occurences of the chracters in the string, i.e. if input is "hello" then the output 
is "eholl".
