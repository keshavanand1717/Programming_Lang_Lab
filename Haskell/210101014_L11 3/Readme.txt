Qn brief desc. - Shortest Path and Huffman Codes

I have followed all the instructions as mentioned in the problem statement. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To compile the first program run the command ghc -o Qn1ShortestPath Qn1ShortestPath.hs in the terminal
To run the program run the command ./Qn1ShortestPath in the terminal

This Haskell program is designed to find the shortest path in a maze starting from the top left node to the bottom 
right node. I have used the a modified BFS algorithm to find the shortest path. 
If there is no path possible from start to end then the program prints that path length is -1 and a empty path list.

To compile the Second program run the command ghc -o Qn2Huffman Qn2Huffman.hs in the terminal
To run the program run the command ./Qn2Huffman in the terminal

This Haskell program is designed to find the Huffman codes for the characters provided based on their frequency.
The User needs to proide input in the form of a list tuples of characters and their frequency which looks like 
[('a', 45), ('b', 13), ('c', 12), ('d', 16), ('e', 9), ('f', 5)].
