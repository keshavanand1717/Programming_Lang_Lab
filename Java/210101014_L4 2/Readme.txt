I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the mail with the problem statement verbatim. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To compile the program use command "javac Main.java" in the terminal
To run the program use command "java Main" in the terminal


Some critical points in the program are - 
- I have used locks to synchronize the program which makes sure that either foo or bar thread is run at a particular moment.
- I have used a variable (turnFoo) which makes sure that foo is printed first and then only bar is printed.
- The user can have a random number(1-100) of repeatitions if he enters 0 as the user input.
- I have made sure that if the user input is a negative number he is prompted to give another input.
- I have done error handling in the program and handled the various possible exceptions. 
- I have written the commnets for other details.
