I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the mail with the problem statement verbatim. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To compile the program use command "javac PackageDeliverySimulation.java" in the terminal
To run the program use command "java PackageDeliverySimulation" in the terminal


Some critical points in the program are - 
- I have used synchronized method to make sure there is no race conditions.
- I have given the ID to the delivery man as 101, 102, 103....etc.
- Anyone of the delivery man who is free/available at the moment is selected for the delivery 
  i.e no particular order among the available delivery men.
- I have implemented sleep using the java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit class.
- I have used the SimpleDateFormat as mentioned in the problem.
- I have taken the input from the user for number of packages and the number of deliverymen.
- I have written the commnets for other details.
