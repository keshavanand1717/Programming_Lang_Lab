Qn brief desc. - Prolog Goldbach Conjecture

I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the mail with the problem statement verbatim. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To run the program run the command "swipl" in the terminal
Then enter the program directory and use command "construct('Program.pl')." in the terminal
Then enter the various queries mentioned in comments (or other queries) of the source code to test the various test cases

- I have implemented iterative loop using between in prolog to find the 2 prime numbers whose sum equals the given even number. As Goldbach conjecture 
  gurantees that the 2 primes exist, so we are sure that the program will provide a output if a valid input it provided.

- I have handled the invalid input cases as well, so that the user gets instruction to enter a valid input if he enters an
  invalid one. 

- I have printed one possible pair of primes whose sum equals the given even number.
