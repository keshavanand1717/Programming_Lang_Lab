Qn brief desc. - Prolog Email Processing Program

I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the mail with the problem statement verbatim. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To run the program run the command "swipl" in the terminal
Then enter the program directory and use command "construct('emailProcess.pl')." in the terminal
Then enter the various queries mentioned in comments of the source to test the various functionalities of the program


This Prolog program is designed to perform various string processing tasks related to email addresses.
The program utilizes Prolog's pattern matching and recursion to process lists of strings representing email addresses. It defines predicates to filter valid emails based on a specified domain, extract usernames from emails, count emails by domain, and generate email addresses from usernames and a domain.
includes predicates for filtering valid emails, extracting usernames, counting emails by domain, and generating email addresses.
