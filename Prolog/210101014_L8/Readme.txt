Qn brief desc. - Sorting List of lists based on size of lists

I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the question paper. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To run the program run the command "swipl" in the terminal
Then enter the program directory and use command "construct('Ssort.pl')." in the terminal
Then enter the query mentioned the the comment at the very end of the program to test the program's functionality


This Prolog program is designed to sort the list of lists based on the size of the list. I have built a custom compare function 
to decide the order of the comparison. I have not assumed any order among the lists having the same length.
