Qn brief desc. - Bioinformatics Challenge - Genetic Data Compression 

I have followed all the pointwise instructions as mentioned in the mail with the problem statement verbatim. I have written comments 
to explain the different parts of the program. 

To run the program run the command "swipl" in the terminal
Then enter the program directory and use command "construct('geneticDataCompressor.pl')." in the terminal
Then enter the query mentioned the the comment at the very end of the program to test the program's functionality


This Prolog program is designed to compress the genetic data in the InputFile and write the output in the outputFile.
The program implements various predicates to read input file, count the number of consecutive occurences, convert
the output to string and to write the output to the output file.

Note-
User needs to provide the name of the input file and the output file in the main predicate.
The input file needs to be present in the directory of the program file.
Input file should contain a valid gentic sequence although the program will run in all cases.

In case of any discrepancies please write to - anand.keshav@iitg.ac.in
